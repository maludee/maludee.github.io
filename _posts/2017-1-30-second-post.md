title: Predicting success in the NBA
---

How did I define success?

In this case, I chose win/loss ratio - in other words, the total amount of wins a team achieves in a season divided by the total amount of losses. 

The background on this project:
The general goal was to scrape some data from the web, and make a prediction with it. I chose to focus on basketball because I wasn't too familiar with the sport and thought it would be a fun way to learn some new things!

I chose to scrape the data from basketball-reference.com, which has a huge amount of data about basketball, going all the way back to the 1940s.

Model # 1:
As someone who didn't know too much about basketball, I was interested in which features would be the most predictive of NBA success. So for my first model, I scraped a fairly diverse group of statistics, including offensive stats, defensive stats, and descriptive features about players. For example, my data included the average points scored by player, their pace, number of steals, age, average salary, and several other features.

I scraped the information by player by team, but then narrowed my information down to focus only on the starting five for each team. I thought that this would be a fairly simple way to then use this information to make decisions about who should spend the majority of their time on the court.

Another metric that I added in was "strong link" or "weak link."
