title: Analysing NYC Subway Data
---

What's the best place in NYC to gather signatures?

For our first project at Metis, we analysed MTA turnstile data to determine the best places for a (fictional) organisation to place canvassers. 

The MTA posts weekly data files with information about how many people enter or exit all 472 subway stations in the city, broken out by turnstile, date, and time. 

The organisation in question had a few concrete goals:

1. Raise awareness/gather signatures
2. Boost attendance for an early-summer gala
3. Get donations

With these considerations in mind, we decided to focus on a few different factors. The most important consideration was traffic - in other words, we wanted to use the MTA data to figure out how many people were going in and out of the different subway stops during the period of time we were examining (April - June 2016). We also wanted to further narrow our focus by considering the income of the neighborhood as well - it seemed like a simple way to reach people who might have more to donate.

Our group was also lucky to have someone who had real-life canvassing experience. They told us about a few other factors that we may not have otherwise considered. For example, it's useful to send a team of canvassers to a location a few times - that way, someone walking by can get several opportunities to stop for a canvasser. Then, after spending about a week at a location (for a full day), the team rotates to a new station. Having this expertise was not only very interesting, but also helped up think about how many subway stations we should recommend to the organisation. At first it seemed like it would be simple to recommend a handful of stations - maybe five or ten - but after speaking to our real-life canvasser, we realized that a larger list of about fifty stations would be more practical.
